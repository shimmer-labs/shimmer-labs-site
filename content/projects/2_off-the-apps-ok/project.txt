Description:

## The Challenge
Stillwater needed a way to discover local events without relying on dating apps. People wanted authentic, in-person connections.

## The Solution
Built an automated content pipeline that:
- Scrapes event data from multiple sources
- Uses OCR to extract text from flyers sent via Telegram
- AI agent (ChatGPT) curates and categorizes events
- Auto-generates Instagram posts with Canva templates
- Posts 3x weekly without manual intervention

## The Tech
The entire system runs on n8n workflows connecting:
1. Telegram bot receives event flyers
2. OCR extracts details
3. Google Sheets stores and deduplicates
4. ChatGPT writes engaging captions
5. Canva API creates branded graphics
6. Instagram API publishes automatically

----
Results: Curates 20+ events weekly, automates content creation, and supports a growing community of app-free daters and local explorers in Stillwater, OK.
