Description:

## The Challenge
Finding relevant government contracts meant manually checking dozens of procurement portals daily. Opportunities were scattered across federal, state, and local sites with no unified search. Hours wasted, deals missed.

## The Solution
Built an Apify actor that:
- Scrapes state and federal procurement websites automatically
- De-duplicates opportunities across multiple sources
- Filters contracts by industry, size, and priority
- Aggregates 100+ opportunities weekly into one feed
- Flags high-priority listings based on custom criteria
- Eliminates manual hunting across scattered portals

## The Tech
The pipeline connects:
1. Apify actor scrapes government contract sites on schedule
2. n8n workflow processes and enriches the data
3. Google Sheets serves as the initial staging area
4. Airtable becomes the single source of truth with filtering
5. Slack API sends priority alerts to the team
6. Automated weekly reports summarize new opportunities

----
Results: Aggregates 100+ opportunities per week, eliminates hours of manual portal checking, and creates a single filterable database for partnerships and deal tracking.
