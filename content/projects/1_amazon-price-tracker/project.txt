- Sends email notifications when thresholds are met
- Supports deal seekers and competitive analysis use cases
- Handles user authentication and account management
- Processes payments through Stripe integration
- Visualizes price trends with interactive charts

## The Tech
Full-stack implementation with:
1. Node.js backend handles scraping and business logic
2. Supabase manages database, auth, and real-time updates
3. Email API sends price change notifications
4. Stripe integration for subscription payments
5. Chart.js displays price history and trends
